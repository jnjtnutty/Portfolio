## MULTIUSER VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) FOR DESIGNING AND EDITING 3D MODELS
This research proposes the development of a virtual reality system in which multiple users could collaboratively design and edit 3D models. In the virtual environment, users also obtained the rendered version of the actual environment using the Kinect’s point clouds. The proposed system provides several features of model building, coloring, realistic dimensions of actual environment, user’s collaboration, and STL file exporting for 3D printing.<br/>
